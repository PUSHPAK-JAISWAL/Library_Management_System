# Contributing to Library_Management_System

We welcome contributions from everyone! By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our code of conduct (if you have one, link it here, e.g., `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`).

Since this is a simple project without formal versions or branches, our contribution process is straightforward.

## 1. Reporting Issues

If you find a bug, have a feature request, or just want to ask a question, please use the **GitHub Issues** page.

### When reporting a bug:

* **Be specific:** Describe the problem in detail.
* **Provide steps to reproduce:** Include clear, numbered steps that anyone can follow to see the bug themselves.
* **Describe expected vs. actual results:** What did you think would happen, and what actually happened?

## 2. Making Contributions (Pull Requests)

The best way to contribute code is through a **Pull Request (PR)**.

1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  **Clone** your forked repository locally.
3.  Create a **new branch** for your feature or fix (e.g., `fix/bug-in-file-x` or `feat/add-new-function`).
4.  Make your changes.
5.  Commit your changes with a clear, descriptive message (see section 3 below).
6.  **Push** your branch and create a **Pull Request** targeting the main branch of this repository.

### What to include in your PR description:

* Reference any related issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
* Explain the problem your PR solves.
* If it's a new feature, explain what it does and why it's useful.

## 3. Style and Commit Guidelines

To keep the project clean, please follow these simple guidelines:

* **Code Style:** Match the existing code style. Keep it simple, readable, and well-commented where the logic is not immediately obvious.
* **Commit Messages:** Please use clear and concise commit messages. A good format is `Type: Short summary (max 50 chars)`.
    * **Types include:** `feat` (new feature), `fix` (bug fix), `docs` (documentation), `style` (formatting, no code change), `refactor` (code structure change), `test` (test-related changes).
    * *Example:* `fix: Corrected typo in main function variable name`
* **Testing:** If possible, test your changes thoroughly before submitting a PR.
